The Library Management System is a web-based application developed using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf to efficiently manage and showcase library resources. The homepage introduces the system with sections highlighting the Reading Hall, Books Collection, and Digital Resources such as e-books and online journals.
The system provides a structured library listing page, where each library entry includes:
ID
Library Name
Location
Total Books
